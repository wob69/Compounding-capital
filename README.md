This repository visually illustrates the core financial concepts of **compounding** and **discounting**, demonstrating clearly how present and future values are interconnected through the **time value of money** principle.

## 📚 About the Project

The time value of money (TVM) is a fundamental financial principle that states that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future, due to its potential earning capacity.

This repository provides clear diagrams and educational materials illustrating:

- **Compounding**: Calculating future value from present value.
- **Discounting**: Calculating present value from future value.

## 🔍 Concepts Explained

### ✅ Compounding

Compounding grows a present amount (`C₀`) into a future value (`Cₙ`) by applying interest (`i`) over time (`n` periods):

C_n = C_0 \times (1 + i)^n

### ✅ Discounting

Discounting determines the present value (`C₀`) of a future amount (`Cₙ`) by reversing the compounding operation:

C_0 = \frac{C_n}{(1 + i)^n}
